# Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains architectural diagrams and visual documentation for the DecentraMind platform.

## 📋 **Diagram Types**

### **System Architecture**
- **High-level Architecture**: Overall system design and component relationships
- **Component Diagrams**: Detailed component interactions
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Information flow between systems
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure and deployment architecture

### **User Flows**
- **Authentication Flow**: Wallet connection and user authentication
- **Agent Creation Flow**: Agent minting and evolution process
- **DAO Governance Flow**: Proposal creation and voting process
- **Staking Flow**: Token staking and reward claiming

### **Blockchain Integration**
- **Smart Contract Architecture**: Contract relationships and interactions
- **Transaction Flow**: On-chain transaction processes
- **Token Economics**: DMT/DMTX token flow and distribution
- **Governance Structure**: DAO governance and voting mechanisms

## 🎨 **Diagram Standards**

### **Format Requirements**
- **Primary Format**: Mermaid (`.md` files with mermaid code blocks)
- **Backup Format**: PNG/SVG for complex diagrams
- **Version Control**: All diagrams tracked in Git
- **Naming Convention**: `[type]-[name].md` (e.g., `architecture-system-overview.md`)

### **Style Guidelines**
- **Colors**: Consistent color scheme across all diagrams
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts
- **Icons**: Standard icons for different component types
- **Layout**: Logical flow from left to right, top to bottom

## 🔧 **Creating Diagrams**

### **Mermaid Syntax**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Wallet Connection]
    B --> C[Authentication]
    C --> D[Platform Access]
    D --> E[Agent Management]
    E --> F[DAO Governance]
    F --> G[Staking & Rewards]
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on key relationships and flows
- **Use Consistent Naming**: Standardize component and process names
- **Include Legends**: Explain symbols and colors used
- **Update Regularly**: Keep diagrams in sync with implementation
- **Version Control**: Track changes in Git

## 🔗 **Integration**

### **Documentation Links**
- **Architecture.md**: Links to system architecture diagrams
- **Module Documentation**: Links to relevant user flow diagrams
- **API.md**: Links to blockchain integration diagrams

### **Maintenance**
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly diagram review and updates
- **Change Tracking**: Update diagrams when architecture changes
- **Quality Checks**: Ensure diagrams are accurate and current
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate team feedback
