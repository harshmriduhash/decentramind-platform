# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Overview**

DecentraMind is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our users' assets and data. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security measures.

## üîí **Security Measures**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Solana Wallet Integration**: Secure wallet authentication using cryptographic signatures
- **Firebase Custom Tokens**: Server-side token generation and validation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration

### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection, user consent required
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Data Retention**: Clear data retention policies and automatic cleanup

### **Blockchain Security**
- **Smart Contract Audits**: All contracts undergo security audits
- **Multi-signature Wallets**: Treasury and governance wallets use multi-sig
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all blockchain inputs

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3

- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-7 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

## üîç **Security Testing**

### **Automated Testing**
- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of npm packages
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing

### **Manual Testing**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Security Best Practices**

### **For Developers**
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data

### **For Users**
- **Wallet Security**: Keep private keys secure and never share them
- **Phishing Awareness**: Verify URLs and never enter credentials on suspicious sites
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA where available
- **Regular Updates**: Keep software and wallets updated
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report suspicious activity immediately
