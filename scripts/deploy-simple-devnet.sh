## Contract Addresses (Placeholder for Testing)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| DMT Token | \`$DMT_TOKEN_ADDRESS\` |
| Subscription | \`$SUBSCRIPTION_ADDRESS\` |

## Environment Configuration

Update your \`.env.local\` with these addresses:

\`\`\`bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DMT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$DMT_TOKEN_ADDRESS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$SUBSCRIPTION_ADDRESS
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

1. Update .env.local with the contract addresses above
2. Configure Firebase and AI API keys
3. Run integration tests
4. Test economic flows on devnet
5. Document any issues found during testing

## Note

This is a placeholder deployment for testing the core functionality.
In production, you would deploy actual smart contracts and use real addresses.
